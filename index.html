        <h1>Travo! Become the guide, not the tourist</h1>
        <p>William Charron-Boyle (40264407)</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Dormant industries bloomed anew as a result of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tourism industry is an example of such a subject of reinvigoration. A factor contributing to this uprising includes the recent updates in travelling restrictions worldwide. These changes increased international travel. <a href="https://travelbans.org/">Travelbans.org</a> displays an up-to-date list of all traveling restrictions for fifteen countries. The list suggests that the most restrictive country is China as of September 2024. However, said contry's strictest travelling rule consists of subjecting COVID-19-positive travellers to quarantine. Otherwise, the measures actually describe recommendations for foreigners to wear masks in closed spaces. The source lists most other countries as no longer enforcing COVID-19 tests for entry. Recent international travelling statistics reflect the effects of lifting these bans. <a href="https://www.unwto.org/news/international-tourism-to-end-2023-close-to-90-of-pre-pandemic-levels">UN Tourism</a> indicates that the number of tourists increased since the pandemic's end. This source indicates that tourists in 2023 make up eighty-seven percent of pre-pandemic tourists. These data do not suggest a complete recovery, but rather one that steadily progresses. Eventually observing the total recuperation of the tourism industry's clients would not be surprising. The primary observers of this expected phenomenon would be locals welcoming travellers. An increase of tourists may prove to be disturbing for said locals, however. This issue holds especially for cultural clashes between foreign and local customs. Countries under tension or violent weather may also pose a threat to tourists. A resource warning about upcomming disasters in the host country can save tourist lives. Incorporating information about local customs in said source can also avoid akward situations. Travo! aims to provide such an up-to-date resource for all regions worth a visit. Furthermore, this service doubles as an all-in-one tool for reservations regarding the following items:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hotels or beds and breakfasts,</li>
            <li>Cars or other transportation devices,</li>
            <li>Local events or tours.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Understanding The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Travelling can offer insightful perspectives regarding other human cultures and lifestyles. This activity requires living through what the host contry's locals also experience. Tourism aims to highlight such experiences that offer can offer the most novelty. Safety and social adequacy is key to make this process all the more relaxing. Not all cultures share the same customs, however. What one culture regards as nonchalant may be offensive in another. For instance, Japanese culture considers tipping to restaurant waiters as inappropriate. Failing to consider this fact may lead to uncomfortable social situtations. Differences exist between laws of the host country and the tourist's country of origin. Some tourists may find some foreign laws surprising. New Zealand law defines foreign fruits as illegal contraband due to biosecurity measures. This measure can put a dent in the tourist's budget and sour the experience. Unfortunately, these differences across nations can deter some from ever travelling. War and natural disasters may pose a greater threat to a tourist's well-being, however. No amount of <i>a priori</i> knowledge can help the tourist predict these events' developments. Live information streams describing these disasters would help tourists determine when to seek refuge. This issue applies to countries experiencing any of the following disasters:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Earthquakes,</li>
            <li>Typhoons or hurricanes,</li>
            <li>Floods or tsunamis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The public media associates such coutries with danger, thus impacting their tourism industries. Rosselló et al. [3] reveal the extent of these effects for countries recovering from disasters. These researchers indicate how a volcanic erruption in Iceland promptly almost halved tourist inflow. Sudden changes in interest can hurt economies in countries that are victims of disasters. A toursist's reluctance to avoid countries prone to disasters is understandable, however. Any enjoyable touristic activity intends to amuse participants rather than exacerbating their anxieties. Countries whose militaries resist ongoing attacks experience negative economical impacts for the same reasons. Offering safety protocols when distasters strike may provide tourists some reassurance. This can benefit countries yearning funds for rebuilding what they lost to uncontrollable factors. Overall, two factors contribute a person's distaste of travelling and are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The overwhelming nature of emersing in foreign cultures and respecting unfamiliar rules,</li>
            <li>The threats of potential disasters with unpredictable behaviours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Mitigating these two issues would improve the reputation of some countries of being dangerous. This section's case study on Iceland demonstrates how significant amounts of people require assurance. A resource informing tourists about a country's state and rules can fulfill this demand.

        <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Resources on the Web reveal different reasons that convinced people to not travel. COVID-19 took part in shaping some demographics that reject travelling out of fear. Zheng D. et al. [4] describe how pandemic measures developed fears of travelling among some. This fear persisted even after government lifted restrictions for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Although the researchers only covered the behaviour up to 2021, some fear can remain. The resulting audience can benefit from some reassurance in the form of danger demystification. Understanding such dangers can help this audience reconsider the reasons for their fear. Providing continuous updates on the regions these persons may visit can provide further reassurance.
